# Marketing for Founders
**TL;DR: This is a hyper-practical collection of resources to help founders promote their startups.**

Let’s face it. Marketing is tough, especially if you’re a technical founder moving the first steps with your startup.

While there’s a ton of advice out there, most of the time it's about scaling some VC-funded startup with a big marketing budget to $1,000,000 ARR and 100,000 users.

Inspirational? Sure. Actionable? Not really.

This is why you’ll find here a practical collection of tips, resources, and some tools to help you:
- find the first few users for your startup
- promote your project without a budget
- scale your marketing activities

Let’s get started!

## Social Media Marketing
Managing multiple accounts across all social media platforms can be pretty intense (there’s a reason why it’s a full-time job), however there are a couple of strategies worth trying: building in public and social listening.

**Building in Public** - it’s the easiest social media tactic. In a nutshell, it’s about using your personal profile to share expertise, product updates, and behind-the-scenes content:

- [LinkedIn CEO/Founder playbook](https://www.markepear.dev/blog/linkedin-ceo-founder-playbook)

**Social listening** - tracking and joining online conversations on topics related to your Startup is pretty helpful to get in touch with users and learn more about them:

## Sales & Cold Outreach
Most people hate cold outreach and everything connected with direct sales. Yes, depending on your approach, it might be hard to scale and time-intensive, but cold emails and DMs are the most straightforward way to get in touch with potential users and collect precious early-stage feedback.

So, how can you find people on target? What should you write in your messages? And how can you scale cold outreach?

Should you focus on SEO in the early days of your startup? Probably not, SEO takes time (and backlinks), but this doesn’t mean you should neglect it either.

SEO is the foundation for many startups, and it can get you a steady source of traffic without having to spend anything other than the time to do it.
