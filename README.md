# Marketing for Founders
**TL;DR: This is a hyper-practical collection of resources to help founders promote their startups.**

Let‚Äôs face it. Marketing is tough, especially if you‚Äôre a technical founder moving the first steps with your startup.

While there‚Äôs a ton of advice out there, most of the time it's about scaling some VC-funded startup with a big marketing budget to $1,000,000 ARR and 100,000 users.

Inspirational? Sure. Actionable? Not really.

This is why you‚Äôll find here a practical collection of tips, resources, and some tools to help you:
- find the first few users for your startup
- promote your project without a budget
- scale your marketing activities

Let‚Äôs get started!

## üì∑ Social Media Marketing
Managing multiple accounts across all social media platforms can be pretty intense (there‚Äôs a reason why it‚Äôs a full-time job), however there are a couple of strategies worth trying: building in public and social listening.

**Building in Public** - it‚Äôs the easiest social media tactic. In a nutshell, it‚Äôs about using your personal profile to share expertise, product updates, and behind-the-scenes content:
- [How to Build in Public as a Founder](https://www.failory.com/blog/building-in-public)

- [LinkedIn CEO/Founder playbook](https://www.markepear.dev/blog/linkedin-ceo-founder-playbook)

**Social listening** - tracking and joining online conversations on topics related to your Startup is pretty helpful to get in touch with users and learn more about them:

## ‚ùÑ Sales & Cold Outreach
Most people hate cold outreach and everything connected with direct sales. Yes, depending on your approach, it might be hard to scale and time-intensive, but cold emails and DMs are the most straightforward way to get in touch with potential users and collect precious early-stage feedback.

So, how can you find people on target? What should you write in your messages? And how can you scale cold outreach?

## üìà SEO
Should you focus on SEO in the early days of your startup? Probably not, SEO takes time (and backlinks), but this doesn‚Äôt mean you should neglect it either.

## üíå Email Marketing
Email marketing can help you with almost anything: onboarding new users, boosting free-to-paid conversions, promoting affiliate/referral programs, and collecting feedback. Plus, it‚Äôs often your only option to engage users outside of your product.

## Content Marketing
Just like SEO, content marketing is one of the first growth levers to pull for a startup. This time, instead of creating content to praise search engines, you‚Äôll be sharing it where your audience hangs out and hijacking trends for free exposure:

## üë©‚Äçüè´ Influencer Marketing
Going where the audience is is the first rule of marketing. That‚Äôs why partnering with content creators and influencers can help you grow your startup and connect directly with customers.

However, online advice on influencer marketing is often bad and outdated, so let‚Äôs take a look at a few firsthand experiences:
