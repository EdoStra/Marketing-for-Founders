# Marketing for Founders
**TL;DR: This is a hyper-practical collection of resources to help founders promote their startups.**

Let’s face it. Marketing is tough, especially if you’re a technical founder moving the first steps with your startup.

While there’s a ton of advice out there, most of the time it's about scaling some VC-funded startup with a big marketing budget to $1,000,000 ARR and 100,000 users.

Inspirational? Sure. Actionable? Not really.

This is why you’ll find here a practical collection of tips, resources, and some tools to help you:
- find the first few users for your startup
- promote your project without a budget
- scale your marketing activities

Let’s get started!

## Social Media Marketing
Managing multiple accounts across all social media platforms can be pretty intense (there’s a reason why it’s a full-time job), however there are a couple of strategies worth trying: building in public and social listening.

**Building in Public** - it’s the easiest social media tactic. In a nutshell, it’s about using your personal profile to share expertise, product updates, and behind-the-scenes content:

- [LinkedIn CEO/Founder playbook](https://www.markepear.dev/blog/linkedin-ceo-founder-playbook)

**Social listening** - tracking and joining online conversations on topics related to your Startup is pretty helpful to get in touch with users and learn more about them:
